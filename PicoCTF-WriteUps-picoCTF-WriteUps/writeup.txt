CHALLENGE: Redaction gone wrong
Author: Mubarak Mikail
Description
Now you DON’T see me. This report has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

Solution:
Redaction is the process of permanently removing sensitive information from a document before sharing it.
So we could see some of the data in the pdf is masked so the vulnerability is "Visual redaction" instead of actual data removal.
Hence we used "pdftotext redaction.pdf output.txt" command to extract the texts to a output.txt file, and cat the output.txt file returned the flag. pdftotext ignores graphical overlays and extracts only textual content, exposing the hidden information.
